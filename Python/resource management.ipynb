    "# The with Statement Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python with statement creates a runtime context that allows you to run a group of statements under the control of a context manager. Compared to traditional **try … finally** constructs, the with statement can make your code **clearer, safer, and reusable.** \n",
    "To write a with statement, you need to use the following general syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with expression as target_var:\n",
    "    do_something(target_var)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The context manager object results from evaluating the expression after with. In other words, expression must return an object that implements the **context management protocol**. This protocol consists of two special methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **.\\_\\_enter\\_\\_()** is called by the with statement to enter the runtime context. typically provides the setup code. \n",
    "2. **.\\_\\_exit\\_\\_()** is called when the execution leaves the with code block. This method typically provides the teardown logic or cleanup code, such as calling .close() on an open file object\n",
    "\n",
    "The as specifier is optional. If you provide a target_var with as, then the return value of calling **.\\_\\_enter\\_\\_()** on the context manager object is bound to that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Some context managers return None from .__enter__() because they have no useful object to give back to the caller. In these cases, specifying a target_var makes no sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how the with statement proceeds when Python runs into it:\n",
    "1. Call expression to obtain a context manager.\n",
    "2. Store the context manager’s **.\\_\\_enter\\_\\_()** and **.\\_\\_exit\\_\\_()** methods for later use.\n",
    "3. Call **.\\_\\_enter\\_\\_()** on the context manager and bind its return value to target_var if provided.\n",
    "4. Execute the with code block.\n",
    "5. Call **.\\_\\_exit\\_\\_()** on the context manager when the with code block finishes."
